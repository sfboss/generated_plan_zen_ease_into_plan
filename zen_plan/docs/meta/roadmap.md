# Roadmap :map:

## Near-Term (1–2 Cycles)

-   Add remaining daily pages (02–90) with progressive nuance.
-   Implement previous/next navigation macros for automatic linking.
-   Expand examples of mindful task variants.

## Mid-Term (3–6 Cycles)

-   Optional audio posture walkthrough (accessible transcript).
-   Phase-specific printable summary sheets.
-   Light dark-mode optimized SVG diagrams for posture alignment.

## Long-Term

-   Community feedback loop integration (anonymous suggestions form) preserving privacy.
-   Localization (language translations) with cultural adaptation notes.
-   Integration of optional timer configuration guidance.

## Guiding Principles for Additions

| Principle        | Rationale                                |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Clarity          | Lower cognitive load                     |
| Cultural Respect | Maintain attribution integrity           |
| Accessibility    | Support diverse bodies & contexts        |
| Sustainability   | Avoid feature bloat; preserve simplicity |

!!! tip "Extension Idea"
Add tag clusters for emergent themes (e.g., theme:gratitude) only after consistent appearance across multiple pages.
