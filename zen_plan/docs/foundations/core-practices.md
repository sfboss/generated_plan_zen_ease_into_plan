# Core Practices :anchor:

This section operationalizes the main training modalities used across phases.

## 1. Seated Meditation (_Zazen_)

Focus: Steady, relaxed attention with compassionate self-correction.

### Basic Sequence

1. Prepare space; brief tidy = ritual cue.
2. Assume posture (see [Posture & Breath](../getting-started/posture-and-breath.md)).
3. Set gentle timer (no harsh buzzer).
4. Anchor attention in breath tactile sensations or whole-body sitting.
5. When distracted, note softly ("thinking", "hearing") and return.
6. Close with 1–2 broader aware breaths, optional bow.

!!! tip "Return Script"
"Notice → Label → Soften → Re-anchor." Keep it swift and kind.

### Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall           | Reframe                                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chasing calm      | Practice = relationship with present conditions. Calm appears, not manufactured. |
| Harsh self-talk   | Replace with neutral observation: "attention wandered; returning."               |
| Forcing stillness | Allow micro-adjustments; stillness grows organically.                            |

## 2. Walking Meditation (_Kinhin_)

Purpose: Bridge seated clarity into movement; release stiffness.

-   Pace: ~½ normal speed, natural breathing.
-   Attention: Footfall sequence (heel → mid → toe) or shifting weight.
-   Duration: Starts at 2–3 minutes Phase 02; lengthens modestly.

!!! note "Transition"
Begin walking immediately after a sit; maintain continuity—avoid checking phone first.

## 3. Bowing (Optional)

Simple 1–3 bows before/after sitting foster humility and gratitude. Keep movements fluid, not theatrical. Accept without self-judgment if skipped.

## 4. Chanting (Optional)

Light vocal toning or a brief phrase (e.g., a compassion aspiration) can stabilize breath rhythm. Keep volume moderate; focus on embodied vibration.

## 5. Mindful Daily Tasks

Select routine actions (eating first bite, washing hands, closing a door) as micro-labs for presence. Attend to tactile, visual, auditory details for 1 deliberate cycle.

!!! example "Door Closing Practice"
Feel hand contact, hinge movement, sound fading. One breath afterward recognizes completion.

## 6. Journaling & Reflection

Use prompts (see [Journaling Prompts](../reflection/journaling-prompts.md)). Keep entries concise (3–6 lines). Focus on patterns, not literary polish.

## 7. Introductory Koan Curiosity (Phase 04+ Optional)

Treat a brief phrase ("Original face before parents were born") as a gentle wonder cue—not analytical riddle. Let it soak pre- or post-sit without force.

!!! caution "Depth Boundaries"
Intensive koan curricula require teacher guidance. Stay at exploratory edge; discontinue if agitation arises.

## 8. Metrics Tracking

Record minutes sat, restlessness episodes (stand-up urges), and clarity (1–5). Trendlines reveal when lifestyle factors affect stability.

## Integration Strategy

Rotate focal emphasis: posture → breath refinement → attitude softness → compassion → consistency. This prevents stagnation and widens capacity arcs.

Regular, kind repetition metabolizes instructions into lived skill. Depth = Consistency × Discernment × Time.
