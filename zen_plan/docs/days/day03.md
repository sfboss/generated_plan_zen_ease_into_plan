# Day 03 – Label & Soften :label:

## 1. Intent

Strengthen non-reactive recognition of wandering by applying soft category labels then re-anchoring without critique.

## 2. Core Practice (6–7 minutes)

Sit as prior days. When pulled away, silently name broad category: "thinking", "hearing", "feeling". Immediately return to breath texture.

## 3. Guided Structure

```text
00:00–00:30  Posture + intention
00:30–06:30  Breath anchor with soft labels
06:30–07:00  Open 2 breaths + bow
```

## 4. Technique Focus – Minimal Label

One quiet word only; avoid narrative elaboration.

## 5. Optional Expansion

Add 30 seconds focusing on exhale length softness if agitation present.

## 6. Micro-Habit

Repeat identity phrase post-sit: "I show up with kindness."

## 7. Reflection Prompts

-   Most frequent label today?
-   Labeling impact on return speed?
-   Tone shift compared to Day 01?

## 8. Cultural Insight

Soft labeling echoes pragmatic noting styles seen in various contemplative lineages—adapted here lightly to avoid mechanical proliferation.

## 9. Mindful Action

One ordinary door opening: note reach, contact, release sequence.

## 10. Metrics to Track

Minutes, restlessness, clarity, dominant distraction category.

## 11. Troubleshooting

Excess labeling? Skip labels for 1 minute, just return silently.

## 12. Safety & Wellbeing Note

If irritability spikes, shorten sit by 1 minute—quality over endurance.

## 13. Tomorrow Preview

We consolidate posture and introduce optional breath count stabilization.
