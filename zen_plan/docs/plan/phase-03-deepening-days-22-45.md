# Phase 03: Deepening :ocean:

<div class="phase-banner">Focus: Longer sits, textured attention, everyday task mindfulness, optional chanting/bowing layer.</div>

## Objectives

-   Increase sit duration gradually to 18–22 minutes.
-   Introduce one mindful daily task practice block.
-   Explore optional brief chanting (single phrase) or 1–3 bows.
-   Maintain journaling with richer pattern extraction.

## Duration Strategy

Increase in 1–2 minute increments only after two consecutive days of clarity ≥3 and restlessness ≤2.

## Suggested Weekly Arc

```text
Mon–Wed: Stable duration
Thu: +1m if criteria met
Fri: Maintain
Sat: Mindful task emphasis
Sun: Weekly review + consolidation
```

## Mindful Daily Task Examples

| Task              | Focus Details                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| First Bite Eating | Texture, temperature, chewing cycles        |
| Hand Washing      | Water temperature, tactile shift soap→rinse |
| Door Closing      | Contact, hinge sound decay                  |
| Email Opening     | Pause breath before first click             |

## Optional Chanting

A soft, steady phrase (e.g., compassion aspiration) 30–60 seconds post-sit can anchor intention. Keep volume modest; prioritize sincerity over melody.

!!! note "Bowing Integration"
1–3 bows mark transitions. If rushed, skip; ritual should clarify, not burden.

## Technique Emphasis Blocks

| Day Range | Emphasis                                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 22–30     | Durational stability + sensory granularity            |
| 31–38     | Open peripheral awareness with stable anchor          |
| 39–45     | Unified field (sounds + breath) without losing center |

## Cultural Insight

Task mindfulness echoes traditional _samu_ (work practice) where attention saturates simple labor (sweeping, cooking). We adapt to modern micro-activities.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                              | Adjustment                                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Plateau in clarity                 | Shift anchor occasionally (nostrils → belly) for 1 sit.       |
| Rising restlessness at 18+ minutes | Insert 2 slow standing breaths mid-sit (quietly) then resume. |
| Ritual over-complexity             | Audit additions; keep only those genuinely supportive.        |

## Transition Criteria to Phase 04

-   Average sit ≥18m with manageable restlessness
-   Mindful task practiced daily (even brief)
-   Optional elements not degrading core stability

Proceed to **[Phase 04](phase-04-integration-days-46-60.md)** after Day 45 or adapt pacing as needed.
