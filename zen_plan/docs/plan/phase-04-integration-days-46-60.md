# Phase 04: Integration :interlaced_rings:

<div class="phase-banner">Focus: Adaptive scheduling, micro-koan curiosity, and broadening everyday embodiment of attention.</div>

## Objectives

-   Maintain 20–25 minute sits with resilience to schedule variability.
-   Introduce micro-koan curiosity (gentle phrase contemplation) without strain.
-   Expand mindful task scope (2–3 varied tasks per day short form).
-   Strengthen compassionate attitudes under fatigue or stress.

## Micro-Koan Curiosity Protocol

1. Select brief phrase (e.g., "What is this?" or classic pointer).
2. Hold lightly for 1–2 breaths pre-sit, then release; do not repeat obsessively.
3. If agitation or compulsive analysis arises, discontinue for that session.

!!! caution "Over-Engagement Risk"
If phrase loops analytically >3 times, reset with 5 breath counts then return to plain sitting.

## Flexible Scheduling Strategy

| Scenario      | Adaptation                                                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Early meeting | Shorten morning sit (60%) + 10m evening top-up            |
| Travel day    | 2 micro-sits (8m + 8m)                                    |
| Fatigue       | Retain single sit at lower band; prioritize sleep hygiene |

## Expanding Mindful Tasks

Alternate tasks: preparing tea, email triage (first 60 seconds), entering a room (hand on doorknob pause), transitioning between digital contexts (one breath, label intention).

## Technique Emphasis

| Sub-Range | Focus                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 46–51     | Scheduling flexibility without quality loss |
| 52–56     | Micro-koan curiosity stability              |
| 57–60     | Compassion infusion & resilience review     |

## Cultural Insight

Classical koan practice involves teacher-guided interviews. Here we employ only a feather-light attitude of wonder—honoring but not replicating formal methods.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                        | Adjustment                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Analytical looping on phrase | Drop phrase entirely 3 days; reintroduce only if curiosity feels spacious.     |
| Schedule slip cascade        | Reinstate fixed anchor time for 5 consecutive days.                            |
| Emotional reactivity spike   | Add 2-minute compassion reflection post-sit ("May I meet this with kindness"). |

## Transition Criteria to Phase 05

-   Maintained average ≥20m sits despite at least one disruption week
-   Micro-koan curiosity not destabilizing attention
-   Multi-task mindfulness integrated daily
