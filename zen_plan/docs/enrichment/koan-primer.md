# Koan Primer (Gentle) :mag_right:

Koans are succinct narratives, dialogues, or phrases historically used within teacher-student relationships to catalyze direct experiential insight beyond conceptual framing. This primer offers respectful orientation—not a self-study curriculum.

## Nature of Koans

-   Function: Disrupt habitual conceptual ruts; evoke fresh perception.
-   Structure: Often paradoxical or sparse, prompting experiential inquiry.
-   Process: In formal settings, a practitioner presents embodied understanding to a teacher over iterative interviews.

## Why Caution Here

Without guidance, intense conceptual looping or premature certainty can arise. We therefore limit engagement to micro-koan curiosity—brief, non-analytic wonder pre- or post-sit.

## Micro-Koan Curiosity Steps

1. Read phrase once (e.g., "Original face?").
2. Sense bodily response (tightness, openness, neutrality).
3. Let phrase dissolve; sit normally.
4. Post-sit: Note any quality shift without forcing interpretation.

!!! caution "Avoid Riddle Mentality"
Treat phrase as directional pointer, not puzzle demanding solution. If frustration escalates, pause usage for several days.

## Selecting a Phrase

Choose widely known classical pointer or simple inquiry ("What is this?", "Just this breath"). Avoid lengthy collections unsuited for initial exploration.

## Signals to Refrain

| Signal                                     | Action                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Persistent mental spinning                 | Drop phrase; return to breath anchor 1 week                |
| Agitation or anxiety spike                 | Center with grounding; discontinue phrase involvement      |
| Inflated certainty / specialness narrative | Journal observation; re-emphasize ordinary posture clarity |

## Cultural Respect

Koans emerged within nuanced pedagogical ecosystems. Light curiosity honors tradition while acknowledging our simplified context. Full curricula require relational transmission structures.

## Integration Journal Prompt

"What subtle somatic or attentional texture, if any, accompanied holding the phrase briefly?" Keep description concrete.
