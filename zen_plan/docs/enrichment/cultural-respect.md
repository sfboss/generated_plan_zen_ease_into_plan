# Cultural Respect :hand_with_index_finger_and_thumb_crossed:

Respectful adaptation sustains integrity, avoids extraction, and credits source cultures.

## Principles

| Principle                  | Application                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Attribution                | Acknowledge East Asian Buddhist roots when sharing practices.                             |
| Transparency               | Clarify differences between traditional temple life and this simplified plan.             |
| Non-Exoticism              | Avoid romanticizing or commodifying aesthetics (robes, objects) detached from context.    |
| Reciprocity (Aspirational) | Support authentic teachers, translation projects, or community initiatives when feasible. |
| Inclusivity                | Use accessible language; avoid gatekeeping while maintaining accuracy.                    |

## Do / Reframe

| Do                                      | Avoid / Reframe                               |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Credit lineage sources                  | Claiming invention of inherited forms         |
| Use simplified forms with clarity       | Presenting simplifications as superior        |
| Emphasize ethics + compassion           | Treating meditation as productivity hack only |
| Encourage teacher engagement eventually | Dismissing traditional mentorship             |
| Provide cultural context footnotes      | Cherry-picking techniques without attribution |

!!! tip "Language Care"
Use Japanese terms sparingly with concise definitions at first occurrence; avoid unnecessary sprinkling for aesthetic effect.

## Handling Symbols

If incorporating objects (e.g., a small statue), do so respectfully: clean space, avoid casual placement. Recognize practitioners may opt out of symbolic items while still honoring origins.

## Koan Sensitivity

Koans arise within teacher-student relational containers. Our micro-koan curiosity is an introductory, non-appropriative homage—distinct from formal curricula.

## Commercial Boundaries

Avoid repackaging material purely for monetization without giving back. Ethical sharing includes directing interested peers toward reputable sources.

## Reflection Prompts

-   How do I acknowledge roots when discussing benefits with others?
-   Am I reducing practices to productivity metrics? Adjust framing.
-   One tangible reciprocity act this month?

## Resources for Further Respect Practice

Support translation funds, engage with diverse voices, and maintain humility about partial understanding.
