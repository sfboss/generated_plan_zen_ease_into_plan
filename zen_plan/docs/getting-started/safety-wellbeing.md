# Safety & Wellbeing :shield:

This resource is educational and not a substitute for medical, psychological, or psychiatric care. If you have a history of trauma, severe anxiety, dissociation, or other clinical concerns, consider consulting a qualified professional before intensifying introspective practices.

## Core Guidelines

1. Physical Neutrality: Mild discomfort is normal; sharp or radiating pain is a stop signal—adjust posture.
2. Gradual Duration: Increase sitting length per phase schedule; do not leap ahead on restless days.
3. Emotional Waves: Strong feelings may surface. Name them gently ("sadness present") and return to breath anchor. If distress escalates, open eyes, connect with surroundings, optionally pause practice.
4. Sleep & Nutrition: Fatigue and under-fueling distort practice quality. Address basics first.
5. Hydration & Caffeine: Hydrate pre-sit; moderate stimulants to avoid jitter.

## Red Flags (Seek Support)

-   Persistent panic-like sensations during practice
-   Intrusive traumatic flashbacks
-   Extended insomnia directly linked to sessions
-   Emerging self-harm ideation

!!! caution "If Overwhelmed"
Open eyes, stand, take 10 slow steps feeling soles of feet, name 5 external objects, then decide whether to resume or stop for the day.

## Mind-Body Balance

In early phases, subtle agitation often masquerades as "I must push harder." Often the opposite—softening jaw, widening peripheral vision—stabilizes attention.

## Adaptations

| Situation            | Adjustment                                                                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acute stress spike   | Shorten sit by 50%, add 3-minute walk.                                      |
| Amplified rumination | Label thoughts softly; shift focus to lower belly breath for 5 cycles.      |
| Sleepy/dull          | Straighten spine, brighten light, try 1–2 minutes standing mindful posture. |
| Physical ache        | Re-cushion, switch to chair, maintain upright yet relaxed alignment.        |

## Technology Boundaries

Silence notifications. Consider airplane mode. This trains a boundary around contemplative time, reinforcing habit loop integrity.

## Community & Teachers

Traditional Zen practice often unfolds within communal _sangha_ and teacher relationships. This plan can support solo exploration but does not replace qualified guidance when deeper koan or intensive retreat practice is pursued.

## Closing

Safety is an ongoing stance. Adjust parameters responsively; kindness and discernment sustain longevity.
