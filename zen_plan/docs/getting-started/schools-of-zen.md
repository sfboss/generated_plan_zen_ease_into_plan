# Schools of Zen :classical_building:

Zen in Japan developed distinct yet overlapping styles. This plan draws broadly while staying simple.

## Sōtō

-   Emphasis: _Shikantaza_ ("just sitting")—open, objectless presence.
-   Tone: Steady, gently persistent cultivation; less dramatic emphasis on breakthrough events.
-   Forms: Regular sitting, liturgy, community work practice.

## Rinzai

-   Emphasis: Koan introspection within formal teacher interviews (_dokusan_).
-   Tone: Energetic, sometimes highlighting decisive insight experiences.
-   Forms: Structured koan curricula, dynamic emphasis on direct seeing.

## Ōbaku

-   Historical Blend: Incorporates elements of Chinese Ming-era Chan plus Pure Land influences.
-   Practices: Chanting integral; retains some liturgical diversity.

## Points of Convergence

| Aspect         | Shared Threads                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Core Seat      | Seated meditation central across schools   |
| Ethics         | Emphasis on compassionate conduct          |
| Community      | Value of _sangha_ for stabilizing practice |
| Mindful Action | Everyday tasks as embodiment field         |

## This Plan's Position

We focus on foundational attentional stability, posture, breath, and mindful action. Koan material appears only in a light primer and optional curiosity notes (Phase 04 onward). No institutional alignment implied.

!!! caution "Koans"
Traditional koan engagement is relational—guided by a qualified teacher. Treat any referenced koan as poetic pointer, not a puzzle to force.

## Cultural Respect

Avoid rebranding inherited forms as personal inventions. Acknowledge roots when sharing. Adaptations (e.g., shorter sits, secular language) should be framed as modern adjustments, not definitive replacements.

## Integration

Understanding broad school flavors contextualizes choices (e.g., why we emphasize consistent daily sits before optional koan curiosity). It can also reduce comparison anxiety by revealing diversity of authentic approaches.

Depth emerges less from selecting a "perfect" school early and more from steady, respectful engagement with fundamentals.
