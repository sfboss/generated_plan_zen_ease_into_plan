# Etiquette :handshake:

Etiquette channels attention and respect, creating a subtle ritual container that signals "this matters" to the nervous system.

## Core Principles

1. Simplicity: Reduce clutter in practice space; tidy cushion after use.
2. Punctuality: Start at your scheduled time—signals reliability.
3. Quiet Entry: Approach seat mindfully; brief bow (optional) reinforces transition.
4. Phones Silent: Eliminate avoidable fragmentation.
5. Non-Performance: Practice is not a self-improvement contest; compare less.

## Bowing (Optional)

A small standing or seated bow before and after sits punctuates the session. Keep spine long, hinge at hips slightly, hands in _gassho_ (palms joined). This can foster gratitude and humility without adopting formal liturgy.

## Handling Distractions

-   External noise: Acknowledge "hearing" and let it blend into field.
-   Itches: Wait a breath; if still compelling, scratch simply—no drama.
-   Thoughts: Label softly "thinking" and return.

## Shared Spaces

If practicing near others, a brief explanation of your routine can reduce interruptions. Frame it as quiet wellbeing time.

## Respect for Origins

Acknowledge the historical development in Chinese Chan and Japanese Zen lineages when sharing with others. Credit source cultures rather than presenting practices as newly invented.

!!! note "Ritual vs Dogma"
Light structure (bow, settle, sit, close) is a pragmatic rhythm cue—not compulsory belief.

## Closing a Session

1. Soften focus
2. Notice breath for 2 cycles
3. Small bow or gratitude phrase
4. Stand slowly; integrate awareness into next action

Etiquette refines atmosphere so practice becomes a dependable, gently sacred interval in a secular day.
