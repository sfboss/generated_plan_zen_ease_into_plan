# Welcome :wave:

This program offers a progressive, respectful introduction to foundational practices associated with Zen—chiefly seated meditation (_zazen_) and mindful everyday actions—adapted for contemporary secular settings while honoring historical roots in East Asian monastic culture.

## Guiding Principles

1. Cultural Respect: Credit Japanese Zen lineages while avoiding appropriation.
2. Gradualism: Small increments accumulate into stable capacity.
3. Embodied Awareness: Posture and breath are training vehicles, not ornaments.
4. Compassion & Self-Honesty: Progress includes plateaus; respond with patience.
5. Integration: Practice shows up in how you speak, listen, eat, walk.

## What You Will (Potentially) Cultivate

-   Improved attentional steadiness
-   Gentler self-talk and interpersonal presence
-   Embodied familiarity with pause-before-reacting
-   Nuanced awareness of sensations, emotions, thoughts

None of these are guaranteed outcomes; they emerge variably.

## How It Works

-   5 Phases mapping developmental emphasis
-   Daily page with intent, core instructions, reflection prompts, troubleshooting
-   Weekly review template to adjust rhythm
-   Tag taxonomy to explore practices by theme or skill

## Your Role

Show up daily for the core sit, even if shortened. Read the day page before practice, then revisit prompts after. Keep notes—brief is fine. If a day feels off, adapt rather than abandon.

!!! tip "If You Miss a Day"
Resume gently the next day. Note the conditions that led to the skip and design a micro-adjustment (earlier alarm, pre-set cushion, shorter initial sit) rather than self-criticism.

## What This Is Not

Therapy, religious conversion, or an exhaustive academic history. It's a scaffold for direct experiential learning.

## Next Steps

1. Read [Safety & Wellbeing](safety-wellbeing.md)
2. Learn [Posture & Breath](posture-and-breath.md)
3. Begin at [Day 01](../days/day01.md)

Proceed with curiosity, not urgency.
