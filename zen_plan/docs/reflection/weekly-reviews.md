# Weekly Reviews :calendar:

A 10–12 minute reflective synthesis each week calibrates pacing and prevents drift.

## Review Timing

Perform after completing the final day of a 7-day block (e.g., Day 07, 14, 21...).

## Sections Explained

-   Wins: Concrete, observable ("Sat 7/7", "Posture more stable").
-   Challenges: Neutral phrasing ("Evening fatigue day 3").
-   Adjustments: Specific, testable ("Move sit 20 min earlier").
-   Emerging Questions: Curiosities to watch rather than rush to solve.
-   Integration Score: How well practice influenced daily conduct.
-   Consistency: Full + partial days (micro-habit only) both count.
-   Patterns: Use reflection codes to compress.
-   Compassion Statement: Reinforces non-judgmental stance.

!!! example "Compassion Statement"
"Learning unfolds at its pace; I support it with steadiness and kindness."

## Monthly (Phase) Synthesis

At phase transitions, add:

-   Key Skill Gains
-   Vulnerabilities Noted
-   Next Phase Intention

## Avoid Perfectionism

Imperfect data > no data. If busy, log only consistency, average minutes, and one sentence insight.

Review = Steering Wheel; without it the habit vehicle can veer subtly off course.
