# Journaling Prompts :thought_balloon:

Keep entries concise (3–6 lines). Rotate categories to build multi-dimensional pattern literacy.

## Sensations (SENS)

-   Which bodily region felt most vivid today? How did it change?
-   What textures (warm, pulsing, tight) dominated early vs late sit?
-   Where did subtle ease appear momentarily?

## Emotions (EMO)

-   What was the background tone (pleasant / neutral / unpleasant)?
-   Did any feeling shift during walking practice? Describe.
-   Which emotional note softened after labeling it?

## Thoughts (THO)

-   Most recurring storyline? How early was it noticed?
-   Did labeling shorten a thought loop? Evidence?
-   What belief about "progress" surfaced today?

## Behaviors (BEH)

-   Micro-habit completion friction? Cause + tweak.
-   Which adjustment produced noticeable clarity gain?
-   What environmental cue helped most today?

## Integration

-   One moment daily life felt more spacious—what supported it?
-   How did posture awareness influence a non-practice activity?
-   Where did compassion show up spontaneously?

## Resilience

-   What obstacle appeared? How did you adapt skillfully?
-   Describe a near-skip day and what preserved the streak.

## Meaning & Motivation

-   Why does this matter to future you? One sentence.
-   What long-term value did today's sit quietly affirm?

!!! tip "Compression Technique"
Use codes to prefix bullet lines: "SENS: warmth hands early; EMO: irritability eased minute 6." This speeds weekly synthesis.

## Monthly Reflection Add-On

-   Which capacity (posture, breath, focus, attitude, compassion, resilience) expanded most?
-   What remains tender/vulnerable? Planned support?
