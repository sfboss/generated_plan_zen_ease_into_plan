# Methodology :gear:

This plan synthesizes contemplative tradition with habit design heuristics.

## Design Pillars

| Pillar                | Description                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gradualism            | Incremental duration & complexity escalation prevents overwhelm. |
| Feedback Loops        | Daily metrics + weekly reviews guide adaptive adjustments.       |
| Single Focus Per Day  | Technique focus reduces instruction overload.                    |
| Cultural Attribution  | Context pages & glossary anchor practices historically.          |
| Compassionate Framing | Encourages sustainable engagement over perfectionism.            |

## Instructional Sequencing

1. Stabilize posture & breath (Phase 01)
2. Consolidate rhythm & walking (Phase 02)
3. Expand duration & mindful tasks (Phase 03)
4. Integrate flexibility & micro-koan curiosity (Phase 04)
5. Personalize & reinforce resilience (Phase 05)

## Behavioral Science Integration

-   Habit loops: trigger design, immediate reward, identity reinforcement.
-   Implementation intentions: explicit if-then adaptations (e.g., "If travel, then two shorter sits").
-   Minimal viable action strategy protects streak under stress.

## Pedagogical Tone

Authoritative yet non-dogmatic—offering options with rationale. Emphasis on experiential learning over conceptual accumulation.

## Ethical Emphasis

Cultivation of clarity is framed as support for compassionate responsiveness—not isolated self-optimization.

## Evaluation & Iteration

Data: aggregated clarity/restlessness trends, qualitative journal codes. Adjust progression only when data supports readiness, preventing premature escalation.

!!! note "Why Not Faster?"
Nervous system adaptation and identity integration benefit from consolidation phases; rapid acceleration risks inconsistency relapse.

## Limitations

Self-guided structure cannot replicate nuanced teacher feedback or peer support. Users with complex psychological histories should integrate professional guidance.
