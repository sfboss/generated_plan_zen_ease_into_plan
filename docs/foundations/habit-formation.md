# Habit Formation :repeat:

Meditative depth grows from stable repetition more than occasional intensity. We apply evidence-informed habit mechanics.

## Core Mechanics

| Element              | Description                               | Example in Plan                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Trigger              | Reliable cue preceding behavior           | Cushion placed after breakfast          |
| Simplicity           | Low friction start                        | First 2 breaths = minimum viable action |
| Immediate Reward     | Small positive reinforcement              | Soft bow + one gratitude phrase         |
| Consistency Identity | Self-story of "I am a daily practitioner" | Journaling streak log                   |
| Reflection           | Feedback loop calibrating adjustments     | Weekly review metrics                   |

## Designing Your Trigger Stack

Pair sit with existing stable routines: waking, post-teeth brushing, pre-lunch. If environment shifts (travel), pick a universal anchor (after morning water).

## Motivation vs Systems

Rely on structural reliability, not fluctuating inspiration. Pre-commit by scheduling calendar invites and prepping space each evening.

## Habit Shielding

Anticipate obstacles (late meetings, fatigue) and prepare plan B (earlier micro-sit, shorter evening sit).

!!! note "If You Miss 2 Days"
Revert to previous phase's lower duration for 3 days to rebuild momentum, then resume schedule.

## Identity Statements

Craft a neutral statement: "I practice brief, respectful awareness daily." Repeat post-sit to anchor self-image.

## Streak Tracking Without Fragility

Mark each day with simple symbols (✔, ~ for partial). Avoid all-or-nothing collapse; partial counts maintain chain.

## Behavior Shaping Progression

Increase duration only when current average clarity ≥2.5/5 and restlessness episodes stable or declining over 3-day window.

## Emotional Friction Handling

Name resistance category: fatigue, doubt, boredom, restlessness, self-critique. Apply targeted adaptation (e.g., boredom → increase sensory granularity focus; fatigue → shorten sit + earlier bedtime review).

## Long-Term Loop

Trigger → Action → Reward → Meaning Reflection (why it matters). The final step consolidates intrinsic motivation linking practice to valued life directions (presence with family, ethical responsiveness).

## Compassion as Stabilizer

Self-judgment spikes dropout risk. Replace "I failed" with "Data: energy low; adapt tomorrow's setup." This preserves iterative learning orientation.

Structure + compassionate iteration = sustainable contemplative habit.
