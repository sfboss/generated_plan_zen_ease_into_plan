# Tracking Metrics :bar_chart:

Metrics clarify patterns; they are tools, not grades. Use them to steer adjustments compassionately.

## Core Metrics

| Metric                | Scale / Unit                                                 | Purpose                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Minutes Sat           | Integer (≤ phase band)                                       | Duration adherence        |
| Restlessness Episodes | Count stand-up or intense urge waves                         | Gauge regulation needs    |
| Clarity               | 1–5 subjective (1=foggy, 3=steady moments, 5=rare wandering) | Attention stability trend |
| Mood Pre/Post         | Short descriptor (e.g., tense → calmer)                      | Emotional effect snapshot |
| Sleep Quality         | 1–5                                                          | Confounder detection      |

## Minimal Daily Log Example

```text
Day 12 | 14m | Restless:2 | Clarity:3 | Sleep:4 | Note: Afternoon sit easier than morning fog.
```

## Weekly Aggregation

Calculate averages for Minutes, Clarity, Restlessness. Look for correlated shifts (e.g., low sleep → higher restlessness). Document adjustments planned.

## Avoid Overfitting

Do not chase single-day anomalies. Look for 3–5 day trends before altering core duration.

!!! caution "Metric Fatigue"
If logging feels burdensome, revert to bare minimum: Minutes + Clarity + one qualitative note.

## Qualitative Reflection Codes

| Code | Meaning                    |
| ---- | -------------------------- |
| SENS | Notable sensation patterns |
| EMO  | Dominant emotion tone      |
| THO  | Recurrent thought theme    |
| BEH  | Behavioral adaptation made |

Use codes to compress journaling yet retain analytic richness.

## Visualizing (Optional)

A simple spreadsheet or bullet journal page can plot weekly averages. Avoid perfectionism; coarse granularity is sufficient.

## When to Adjust

-   If Clarity <2 average for 5 days and Sleep ≥3 → shorten sit 10–20% temporarily.
-   If Clarity ≥4 and Restlessness ≤1 for 7 days → consider moving to upper band of next phase.

Track just enough to learn; let practice remain primarily experiential.
