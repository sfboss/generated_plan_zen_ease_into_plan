# Daily Structure Template :spiral_notepad:

Each daily page follows a predictable architecture, lowering friction while permitting nuanced evolution.

## Sections Explained

1. Intent – Motivational framing; why today's focus matters.
2. Core Practice – Duration band & anchor instructions.
3. Guided Structure – Mini schedule clarifying order.
4. Technique Focus – One refinement dimension.
5. Optional Expansion – Variation if capacity available.
6. Micro-Habit – Minimum viable action preserving streak identity.
7. Reflection Prompts – Rotating pattern literacy questions.
8. Cultural Insight – Brief contextual or historical note.
9. Mindful Action – Everyday application to widen integration.
10. Metrics to Track – Quantitative & qualitative anchors.
11. Troubleshooting – Friction & targeted remedy.
12. Safety & Wellbeing Note – Regulate nervous system considerations.
13. Tomorrow Preview – Foreshadow continuity.

## Guided Structure Code Block

Example formatting used in day pages:

```text
00:00–00:01  Settle posture
00:01–08:00  Core sit (breath at nostrils)
08:00–09:00  Mindful stand + stretch
09:00–10:00  2 slow breaths, closing bow
```

## Technique Focus Rotation

| Day Range | Emphasis                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 1–7       | Posture & Breath Basics            |
| 8–21      | Transition & Walking Integration   |
| 22–45     | Attentional Span & Mindful Tasks   |
| 46–60     | Flexibility & Micro-Koan Curiosity |
| 61–90     | Personalization & Resilience       |

## Micro-Habit Philosophy

If nothing else happens, do the micro-habit. This resists identity erosion after disruptions (travel, illness, stress spikes).

!!! tip "When Overwhelmed"
Compress practice to micro-habit + 2 mindful breaths labeling sensations, then resume day. It's a pause, not a failure.

Consistency emerges from well-designed repetition with adaptive kindness.
