# Frequently Asked Questions :question:

## How long should I sit?

Follow the phase band. If distressed, drop to the band's lower bound for 1–2 days; resume gradual increase once stable.

## What if my mind never gets quiet?

Silence is not the criterion. The skill is noticing distraction sooner and returning kindly. That loop is success.

## Chair vs Cushion?

Either. Choose the option supporting upright comfort with minimal strain.

## When is best to practice?

Morning often offers fewer cognitive residues. If schedule conflicts, anchor to a consistent daily event (lunch, sunset).

## Can I listen to music?

For core sits, silence or neutral ambient noise is recommended to cultivate intrinsic attentional steadiness. Soft soundscapes only if environmental noise is highly disruptive.

## Is drowsiness normal?

Yes early on. Improve sleep hygiene, sit with a bit more light, and ensure spine lengthening. Brief standing or walking segment helps.

## What about strong emotions?

Label gently ("sadness" / "anger"), allow bodily sensations, keep breath anchor peripheral. If intensity spikes, open eyes, ground via touch.

## Should I jump ahead days if progressing fast?

No. Honor the pacing. Use surplus capacity for mindful tasks or compassion reflections rather than premature duration escalation.

## Do I need a teacher?

For foundational attention stabilization, self-guided structure can suffice. For intensive koan curricula or deeper integration challenges, qualified teacher support is beneficial.

## What if I miss several days?

Restart at the prior phase's minimum duration for 3–5 days; rebuild gently.

## Can this replace therapy?

No. It's a contemplative skills training scaffold—not clinical treatment.

## How do I measure progress?

Trend improvements in clarity stability, quicker return after distraction, kinder internal tone, integration into daily tasks.

## Why track metrics?

To externalize patterns; memory alone distorts. Light logging informs adaptive tweaks.
