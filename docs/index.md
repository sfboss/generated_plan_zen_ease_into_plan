# Welcome :seedling:

> A calm, sustainable introduction—rooted in tradition, adapted for modern life.

## Value Proposition

This structured 90‑day plan offers a gradual, culturally respectful approach to seated meditation (_zazen_), walking practice (_kinhin_), mindful daily actions, journaling, and compassionate attitudes. It balances consistency with adaptability so you build a durable, life-supporting habit—not a fragile sprint.

## Quick Start

1. Read the short [Welcome](getting-started/welcome.md) and essential [Safety & Wellbeing](getting-started/safety-wellbeing.md) disclaimers.
2. Learn posture & breath fundamentals: [Posture & Breath](getting-started/posture-and-breath.md).
3. Skim the [Daily Structure Template](foundations/daily-structure-template.md).
4. Begin with **Day 01**: [Start Now →](days/day01.md)
5. Each evening, jot 2–3 lines using prompts in [Journaling](reflection/journaling-prompts.md).

!!! note "Daily Navigation"
Use the "Daily Pages" navigation or previous/next links at the bottom of each day page. Phase overview pages contain quick links.

## Habit Loop Model

Trigger → Anchor Posture → 5–30m Sit → Immediate Reward (mini bow & deep breath) → Long-term Meaning (steady clarity, compassionate responsiveness).

!!! tip "Sustainable Pace"
Favor consistency over intensity. A 10m sit done kindly daily outperforms sporadic 40m marathons.
