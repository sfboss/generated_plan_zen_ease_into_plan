# Phase 05: Expansion :mountain:

<div class="phase-banner">Focus: Mature consistency, adaptive personalization, resilience strategies, and compassionate integration.</div>

## Objectives

-   Sustain 25–30 minute sits with stable clarity.
-   Personalize anchor variations (breath / whole-body / ambient sound) skillfully.
-   Apply resilience toolkit after disruptions (illness, travel, emotional spikes).
-   Integrate compassion reflections seamlessly.

## Personalization Guidelines

Rotate anchor only if current clarity ≥3 for 3 consecutive days. Keep change limited (e.g., nostrils → whole-body) to protect stability.

## Resilience Toolkit Snapshot

| Disruption     | Strategy                                            |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Illness        | Shorter sits (40–60%) + gentle body awareness       |
| Travel         | Two shorter segments (e.g., 12m + 12m)              |
| High Stress    | Add 2-minute grounding (feet + lower belly) pre-sit |
| Motivation Dip | Re-read Day 01 intent & journal early gains         |

## Compassion Infusion

Conclude 2–3 sits weekly with silent phrase: "May clarity support kind action." This ties internal development to relational ethics.

!!! tip "Plateau Reframe"
Plateau = consolidation. Let nervous system encode stability before seeking novelty.

## Technique Emphasis

| Days  | Focus                                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 61–70 | Anchor stability at higher duration               |
| 71–80 | Adaptive personalization experiments              |
| 81–90 | Resilience + integration review & future planning |

## Cultural Insight

Longer sits approximate some lay practitioner schedules but remain modest relative to monastic intensives. Quality and ethical embodiment outweigh raw duration.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                | Adjustment                                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Subtle burnout signs | Insert a "light day" (15m sit) weekly.                                       |
| Anchor hopping       | Commit to 5-day blocks per anchor.                                           |
| Compassion fatigue   | Shift to receiving compassion ("May I be patient") before extending outward. |

## Completion Reflection (Day 90)

Assess trends: clarity trajectory, self-talk shifts, integration into relationships, resilience after setbacks. Draft a personal continuation plan (next 30–90 days).

---

After Day 90, either repeat a refinement cycle or design a maintenance schedule (e.g., 25m daily + weekly 35m). Sustainable depth is iterative.
