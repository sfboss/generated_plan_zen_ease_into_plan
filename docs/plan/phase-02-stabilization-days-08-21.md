# Phase 02: Stabilization :footprints:

<div class="phase-banner">Focus: Rhythm consolidation, gentle duration increase, adding walking meditation and richer reflection.</div>

## Objectives

-   Extend core sit to 12–15 minutes by Day 21.
-   Introduce 2–3 minute _kinhin_ (walking) after sit several days per week.
-   Establish journaling pattern with rotating reflection lenses.
-   Strengthen environmental and temporal triggers.

## Duration Ramp (Suggested)

| Day Range | Recommended Sit | Walking Add-On                |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 08–11     | 12m             | Optional 2m (every other day) |
| 12–16     | 13–14m          | 2–3m most days                |
| 17–21     | 14–15m          | 3m daily if stable            |

## Daily Pattern (Representative)

```text
Settle (1m) → Core Sit (12–15m) → Kinhin (2–3m) → Closing Breath → Log Metrics → Journal (Reflection lens rotates)
```

## Reflection Lens Rotation

| Lens       | Prompt Essence    | Sample Question                   |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Sensations | Body feel quality | "What textures dominated?"        |
| Emotions   | Affective tone    | "Dominant feeling tone shift?"    |
| Thoughts   | Cognitive loops   | "Recurring storyline?"            |
| Behaviors  | Habit adjustments | "What micro-habit tweak emerged?" |

## Technique Emphasis

| Week Segment | Focus                                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 08–12        | Breath anchor resilience                                |
| 13–16        | Transition quality (sit→walk)                           |
| 17–21        | Expanding peripheral field while stable anchor persists |

!!! tip "Walking Attentional Thread"
During _kinhin_, let each step be a bead on a continuity string—notice contact, shift, release.

## Cultural Insight

Walking integration echoes monastic alternation patterns (sitting-walking cycles) scaled to lay schedules.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                                   | Adjustment                                                            |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Leg stiffness post-sit                  | Earlier introduction of walking; gentle calf stretch.                 |
| Journaling drift                        | Lower entry to single triad: SENS / THO / ADJ (adjustment).           |
| Increased restlessness with longer sits | Add one midpoint breath count cycle (exhale counts 1–5 then release). |

## Transition Criteria to Phase 03

-   Sit duration ≥13m average last 5 days
-   Walking integrated ≥70% of days without destabilizing sit
-   Journaling entries capture at least 2 different lenses across week
