# Phase 01: Orientation :seedling:

<div class="phase-banner">Focus: Foundation of posture & breath — cultivating gentle ritual and reliable daily showing up.</div>

## Objectives

-   Learn baseline posture and comfortable setup.
-   Initiate 5–10 minute sits.
-   Introduce micro-habit (place cushion pre-breakfast).
-   Begin minimal metrics logging.

## Duration Band

Sit 5m Days 01–03; optionally 7–8m Days 04–05; up to 10m Days 06–07 if clarity ≥2.5 average.

## Daily Pattern

```text
Settle (1m) → Core Sit (5–10m) → 1 breath closing bow → Log metrics → Evening 2-line journal.
```

## Technique Emphasis

| Day Cluster | Emphasis                     |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| 01–02       | Posture alignment basics     |
| 03–04       | Breath anchor stability      |
| 05–06       | Soft labeling of distraction |
| 07          | Consolidation & review       |

## Common Obstacles & Responses

| Obstacle           | Response                                                                |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Restless fidgeting | Micro-adjust once, then note sensations instead of escalating reaction. |
| Sleepiness         | Straighten spine, brighten light, slightly open gaze.                   |
| Self-critique      | Replace with neutral narrative: "Learning noticing-return loop."        |

!!! tip "Micro-Habit Reinforcement"
Pair placing cushion with verbal cue: "Setup done: practice will happen." This imprints environmental trigger.

## Cultural Insight

Foundational attention training parallels introductory forms taught in Sōtō and Rinzai temples, though monastic schedules are far more extensive.

## Transition Criteria to Phase 02

-   Consistency ≥5 of 7 days
-   Ability to re-anchor within ~10 seconds of noticing distraction most attempts
-   Basic comfort with posture adjustments
