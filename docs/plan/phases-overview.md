# Phases Overview :milky_way:

<div class="phase-banner">This 90-day arc unfolds through five adaptive phases—each layering stability, breadth, and resilience.</div>

| Phase            | Days  | Focus                                                | Sit Range |
| ---------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 01 Orientation   | 01–07 | Posture & breath foundations                         | 5–10m     |
| 02 Stabilization | 08–21 | Rhythmic consistency, walking, journaling            | 12–15m    |
| 03 Deepening     | 22–45 | Longer sits, mindful tasks, optional chanting/bowing | 18–22m    |
| 04 Integration   | 46–60 | Flexible scheduling, micro‑koan curiosity            | 20–25m    |
| 05 Expansion     | 61–90 | Personalization & resilience                         | 25–30m    |

## Progression Principles

1. Duration gradually escalates within manageable bands.
2. New modalities introduced only after base stability emerges.
3. Reflection scaffolds (journaling, weekly reviews) calibrate pacing.

## Phase Transition Checklist

Before moving emphasis, confirm:

-   ≥80% practice consistency past 7 days
-   Restlessness episodes stable or declining
-   Clarity average ≥2.5/5

## Navigating Setbacks

If metrics dip, temporarily consolidate—reduce to lower band and simplify optional elements. Resume expansion once steadiness returns.

Trust deliberate pacing; sustainable depth favors patient layering over acceleration.
