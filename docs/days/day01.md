# Day 01 – Settling the Ground :seedling:

## 1. Intent

Begin not by achieving calm but by forming a respectful container. Today success = showing up and noticing at least one distraction + return cycle.

## 2. Core Practice (5–6 minutes)

Sit upright (chair or cushion). Choose one breath location (nostrils OR belly). Let hands rest, thumbs lightly touching. Observe natural inhalation/exhalation sensations. Each time attention drifts, label softly ("thinking", "hearing") and return.

## 3. Guided Structure

```text
00:00–00:30  Set posture, soften jaw
00:30–05:30  Core breath attention (nostrils or belly)
05:30–06:00  One broader body breath + gentle bow
```

## 4. Technique Focus – Posture Triangle

Feel alignment of head–spine–pelvis. Micro-lengthen crown on each exhale release. Avoid rigid locking.

## 5. Optional Expansion (1–2 minutes)

Add two slow mindful standing breaths noticing foot pressure shifts.

## 6. Micro-Habit

Place cushion or chair setup immediately after waking—visual trigger.

## 7. Reflection Prompts

-   What was one vivid sensation?
-   How many distraction → return loops did you observe?
-   Internal tone: harsh, neutral, kind?

## 8. Cultural Insight

Foundational sitting mirrors introductory instruction in Sōtō temples emphasizing ordinary posture over exotic technique.

## 9. Mindful Action

While drinking first water of the day, feel temperature, swallow movement, brief gratitude.

## 10. Metrics to Track

Minutes sat, restlessness episodes, clarity (1–5 subjective), note one distraction category.

## 11. Troubleshooting

Sleepy? Straighten spine & slightly open gaze. Restless? Note localized body sensations before adjusting.

## 12. Safety & Wellbeing Note

Sharp physical pain: adjust immediately. Emotional surge: open eyes, anchor to room (3 objects named), resume or stop kindly.

## 13. Tomorrow Preview

We gently reinforce posture and begin noticing breath texture with slightly longer stability.
