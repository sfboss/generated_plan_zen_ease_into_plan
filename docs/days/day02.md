# Day 02 – Breath Texture Noticing :lotus_position:

## 1. Intent

Deepen familiarity with subtle breath qualities (temperature, movement, micro-pauses) to anchor attention more vividly.

## 2. Core Practice (5–6 minutes)

Same setup as Day 01. Attend at chosen anchor noticing onset, middle, and end of each breath phase. Label distractions neutrally; return.

## 3. Guided Structure

```text
00:00–00:30  Posture settle
00:30–05:30  Breath texture observation
05:30–06:00  2 wider awareness breaths + bow
```

## 4. Technique Focus – Sensory Granularity

Distinguish at least two qualities: e.g., cool inhale at nostrils, warm exhale flow.

## 5. Optional Expansion

Count breaths 1–5 on exhalations once, then release counting.

## 6. Micro-Habit

Reaffirm cushion placement immediately after breakfast cleanup.

## 7. Reflection Prompts

-   Which breath quality stood out most?
-   Distraction labeling tone?
-   Any posture micro-adjustment needed?

## 8. Cultural Insight

Subtle breath attending parallels refined instructions within many early training contexts—stability over complexity.

## 9. Mindful Action

Feel hand sensations (temperature, texture) for first 10 seconds of a routine task.

## 10. Metrics to Track

Minutes, restlessness, clarity, number of noticed distinct breath qualities.

## 11. Troubleshooting

If sensations feel dull, slightly brighten posture; if over-efforting, soften shoulder tension.

## 12. Safety & Wellbeing Note

Stop if dizziness arises from inadvertent breath control; return to natural rhythm.

## 13. Tomorrow Preview

We explore distraction labeling refinement and gentle returning.
