# Day 08 – Phase 2 Beginning: Extended Sitting :hourglass_flowing_sand:

## 1. Intent

Welcome to Phase 2! Today we extend your sitting practice and introduce walking meditation as a complementary movement practice. Focus on rhythm and sustainable pacing.

## 2. Core Practice (12–15 minutes)

Use your established foundation from Phase 1, but extend the duration. Notice how the mind responds to longer sitting. Maintain the same gentle approach—no forcing.

## 3. Guided Structure

```text
00:00–02:00  Settle deeply, set intention for extended sit
02:00–13:00  Core breath awareness with soft labeling
13:00–15:00  Gradual transition to close
```

## 4. New Element: Walking Meditation (5 minutes)

After your sit, practice walking meditation:

**Basic Walking Instructions:**

1. Stand for 30 seconds, feeling feet on ground
2. Begin walking slower than normal pace
3. Coordinate with breath: 2-3 steps per inhale, 2-3 steps per exhale
4. If space is limited, walk back and forth in a line
5. When mind wanders, pause, return to breath-step coordination

**Indoor Space Adaptation:**

-   6-8 foot line works fine
-   Turn mindfully at each end
-   Focus on lifting, moving, placing each foot

## 5. Challenges with Extended Sitting

| Challenge                        | Response                                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Restlessness around 8-10 minutes | Normal! Stay with discomfort briefly, then micro-adjust |
| Mind more active                 | Longer sits reveal mental patterns—good information     |
| Physical discomfort              | Adjust posture once consciously, then note sensations   |
| Time awareness                   | Resist checking time; trust your timer                  |

## 6. Reflection Journaling (3 minutes)

Introduce brief daily reflection. Write 2-3 lines addressing:

-   How did the extended duration feel?
-   What did walking meditation reveal?
-   One word for today's practice quality

## 7. Phase 2 Rhythm

For the next 14 days, this pattern will build:

-   **Sitting:** 12-15 minutes (gradually extending)
-   **Walking:** 5-10 minutes (weather permitting, outdoors preferred)
-   **Journaling:** 2-3 lines daily reflection

## 8. Tomorrow's Preview

Day 9 will explore coordinating breath and movement more deeply during walking practice.
