# Day 04 – Noticing Mind :thought_balloon:

## 1. Intent

Today introduces "soft labeling"—a gentle way to acknowledge mental activity without getting caught in its content. This builds your capacity to observe thoughts rather than be controlled by them.

## 2. Core Practice (7–9 minutes)

Settle into your established posture with chosen breath anchor from Days 2-3. When you notice the mind has wandered, softly whisper one word describing what happened: "thinking," "planning," "hearing," "feeling." Then return to breath.

## 3. Guided Structure

```text
00:00–01:00  Set posture, establish breath anchor
01:00–07:30  Core practice with soft labeling
07:30–09:00  Three deeper breaths + reflection
```

## 4. Technique Focus – Soft Labeling

**Common Labels:**

-   **"Thinking"** - for mental commentary, memories, planning
-   **"Feeling"** - for emotions or physical sensations
-   **"Hearing"** - for sounds that pull attention
-   **"Seeing"** - for visual distractions (if eyes slightly open)

**Key Points:**

-   Use a gentle, neutral tone (not harsh self-correction)
-   One word is enough—don't analyze the content
-   Immediately return to breath after labeling
-   Think of it as noting, not judging

## 5. Common Experience

You might notice more mental activity today because you're paying closer attention. This is awareness expanding, not mind getting busier.

## 6. Working with Challenges

| Challenge                | Response                                                 |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Labels feel harsh        | Whisper more softly, like noting clouds passing          |
| Forgetting to label      | Perfectly normal—just return to breath when you remember |
| Getting lost in labeling | Skip the label if it becomes another distraction         |

## 7. Reflection Prompts

-   What types of mental activity did you notice most?
-   How did labeling change your relationship to thoughts?
-   Did returning to breath feel different after labeling?
