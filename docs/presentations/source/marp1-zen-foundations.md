## The Breath as Teacher 🌬️

**Not controlling, but observing:**

1. **Natural rhythm** - let breath breathe itself
2. **Belly rises** on inhale, falls on exhale
3. **Pause between** breaths - rest here
4. **When mind wanders** - gentle return

> The breath is always available as an anchor to the present moment.

| Never think     | Notice thinking, return to breath   |
| Perfect posture | Stable and comfortable              |
| Immediate peace | Gradual cultivation                 |
| Escape problems | Face reality with clarity           |
