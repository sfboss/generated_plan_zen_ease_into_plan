# How to Use This Plan :compass:

This structure reduces decision fatigue so your cognitive energy goes toward practice.

## Daily Flow

1. Skim today's page once in the morning.
2. Set up cushion or chair ahead of scheduled time.
3. Complete Core Practice.
4. Log metrics (minutes, clarity 1–5, restlessness episodes).
5. Evening: Revisit Reflection Prompts; jot concise notes.

## Weekly Cycle

-   Perform a [Weekly Review](../reflection/weekly-reviews.md) every 7 days (e.g., after Day 07, 14...). Adjust durations within phase range only if consistency ≥80%.

## Phases & Progression

Advancement is by calendar day; you do not need to "earn" entry, but if overwhelmed you can hover within a phase's duration band until stable. Regressing temporarily is acceptable—note adaptation in journal.

## Tags

Browse by interest via the [Tag Index](../tag-index/index.md). For instance, filter to skill:posture or theme:compassion when honing a dimension.

## Habit Architecture

Each day emphasizes a micro-habit ensuring a minimum viable action (MVA). On difficult days, perform only the MVA (e.g., sit 2 mindful breaths) to preserve identity continuity: "I am someone who shows up." This combats all-or-nothing collapse.

!!! example "Micro-Habit Cascade" 1. Place cushion before breakfast (trigger) 2. Sit for scheduled minutes (action) 3. Soft bow + note one breath sensation (immediate reward) 4. Recall long-term meaning statement (meaning consolidation)

## Reflection Layering

Prompts rotate across lenses: Sensations, Emotions, Thoughts, Behaviors. Over weeks this builds pattern literacy—recognizing, for example, that restlessness peaks with poor sleep.

## Optional Elements

Chanting, bowing, and koan-related curiosity are optional. If any evoke confusion or discomfort, skip without penalty.

## Protecting Consistency

Use calendar blocking. Pair sitting with an existing stable routine (e.g., after teeth brushing). Prepare environment: clear clutter, moderate temperature, neutral scent.

## When Busy

Shrink duration, retain form. Even 3 structured minutes maintains neural & identity grooves.

Consistency + kindness > intensity.
