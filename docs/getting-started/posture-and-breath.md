# Posture & Breath :lotus_position:

Stable posture reduces unnecessary struggle, revealing subtler habits of tension.

## Core Alignment

1. Base: If on cushion, sit toward its front so hips slightly higher than knees; if on chair, feet flat, no slouch.
2. Spine: Imagine a gentle upward lengthening—neither rigid nor collapsed.
3. Head: Chin slightly tucked; crown oriented upward; gaze soft 3–6 feet ahead (or half‑closed downward angle if comfortable).
4. Hands: Rest on lap forming an oval with thumbs lightly touching—avoid pressing.
5. Jaw & Face: Soften; allow tongue to rest lightly on roof of mouth behind teeth.

!!! tip "Micro-Scan"
Every few minutes silently check: "Crown lifting? Jaw soft? Breath natural?" Gentle adjustment, then release.

## Breath Principles

-   Natural, unforced, predominantly nasal.
-   Notice tactile sensations at nostrils or belly rise-fall. Pick one anchor per sit.
-   Allow pace to self-regulate; do not engineer deeper or slower unless agitated. If agitation high, lengthen exhale slightly for 3–5 cycles.

## Common Mistakes & Refinements

| Pattern                       | Adjustment                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Over-straightening (rigidity) | Exhale fully and allow spine to re-inflate gently.         |
| Slouching (dullness)          | Re-lengthen crown; widen collarbones subtly.               |
| Breath control                | Shift to receiving sensations rather than producing them.  |
| Numb legs                     | Adjust cushion height; introduce walking practice earlier. |

## Dynamic Balance

Posture is a living conversation with gravity. Subtle micro-movements are normal. The aim: poised neutrality—alert yet unforced.

## Walking (Kinhin) Preview

During _kinhin_, keep similar spinal alignment; hands in a simple clasp or folded at center. Step slowly (~½ normal pace) matching breath to relaxed steps, noticing heel-to-toe roll.

## Chair Sitting Is Valid

Authentic practice is measured by sincerity, not furniture. If chronic pain or circulation issues arise on a cushion, use a chair without self-judgment.

## Troubleshooting Quick Table

```text
Swaying --> Widen base; engage light core support.
Sleepy --> Straighten, open eyes slightly more, increase light.
Anxious --> Emphasize exhale softness; anchor lower belly.
Restless legs --> Short stand, then resume; add walking minute tomorrow.
```

## Integration Cue

Each time you sit down elsewhere (desk, meal), briefly align posture and take one aware breath to reinforce skill generalization.

Posture is compassionate engineering: enough structure to invite wakefulness, enough softness to permit breathing to teach you.
